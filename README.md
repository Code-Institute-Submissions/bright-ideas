## Design 

  ### Colour Scheme

  ![Colour Palette](./media/wireframes/color-palette.png)

  The main colours of the site are **Eerie Black** (#1F1F1F) and **Snow White** (#fffafa).
  These were chosen to give the user an easy on the eye and for good readability.
  I've added a **Gold Web Golden** (#FFD700) for use on buttons and to create a *glow* effect, like a bulb, on
  some elements.

  ### Typography

  For the heading font I have chosen to use [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=raleway&preview.text_type=custom)
  and for the body text I have chosen [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mon&preview.text_type=custom).
  These are popular fonts with easy readability and I feel they compliment each other well.

  ### Wireframes

  I've created the wireframes for this project using Balsamiq Wireframes

## Testing

## Deployment

### Steps for Cloning Locally

  - Go to the project repository Bright Ideas

  - Open Git and select clone from the repository tab. Enter source location Bright Ideas and the location you wish to store the files and press the clone button

  - Clone the project using `git clone`

  - Open your IDE and navigate to the directory where you stored the cloned files

  - Install requirements from requirements.txt file by entering pip3 install -r requirements.txt in the terminal

  - Activate your virtual environment by py -m venv virtual into the terminal

  - Create an environment file env.py to store environment variables. Add environment variables as shown:

  - Run a PostgresSQL database, e.g. [using docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) 

  - os.environ.setdefault('SECRET_KEY', '')
  - os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')
  - os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')
  - os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '')
  - os.environ.setdefault('EMAIL_HOST_USER', '')
  - os.environ.setdefault('EMAIL_HOST_PASS', '')
  - os.environ.setdefault('EMAIL_HOST_USER', '')
  - os.environ.setdefault('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', '')
  - os.environ.setdefault('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', '')
  - os.environ.setdefault('DATABASE_URL', '')

7. Add `env.py` to a `.gitignore` file so sensitive data will not be pushed to GIT

8. Run `python3 manage.py migrate`

9. You should now be able to run the program by entering `python3 app.py` into the terminal

### Deploying to Heroku

  - Go to Heroku website and login or sign up
  - Once logged in click 'new' and 'create new app' like **bright-ideas-bm**
  - Give the app an appropriate name and select your closest region
  - Now click create app
  - On resource tab, in add-ons bar add Heroku Postgres Database
  - To use Postgres you need to go back to gitpod and install *dj-database-url* and *psycopg2-binary*
  - Once installed freeze requirements with pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
  - Set up database by going to settings.py and import *dj-database-url*
  - In settings.py navigate to database settings and replace default database with a call to *dj_database_url.parse()*
  - Add database URL from Heroku settings config vars inside parenthesis
  - Run migrations in gitpod *python3 manage.py migrate* to apply migrations and apply database
  - Import product data by entering *python3 manage.py loaddata categories* and *python3 manage.py loaddata products* in this order
  - Add superuser to log in with *python3 manage.py createsuperuser*
  - **Don't commit** with Heroku database settings visible change database back to original database URL before commit
  - Install gunicorn and freeze requirements 
  - Now we can create our Procfile that tells Heroku to create a web dyno
  - Temporarilly disable *collect static* by entering *heroku config:set DISAABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1 --bright-ideas-bm*
  - Add Host name of heroku app to allowed settings.py, allow local host as well to allow access from gitpod.
  - To push to heroku you may need to initialise your heroku git remote *heroku git:remote -a bright-ideas-bm*
  - Then push to heroku *git push heroku master*
  - We can set up to automatically push to heroku when we push to github by going to the heroku app.
  - Go to deploy tab- In deployment select Github.
  - Search for repository and press connect.
  - Scroll down to automatic deploys and enable them.
  - Get secret key and add to heroku config settings.
  - Go to settings.py remove secret key and replace with a call to get it from the environment *SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')
  - Set debug to be True only if there is a variable called development in the environment *DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ*
